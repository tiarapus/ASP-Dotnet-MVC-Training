# Description
A few months ago, my image processing lecturer offered students the opportunity to join his free web app workshop to learn about the MVC and MVVM architectures using C# ASP.NET. 
I learned a lot about the concepts and how to implement them with the .NET Framework during this three-day comprehensive workshop.

## Project
Students were required to develop interfaces for creating, reading, deleting, and updating data.
